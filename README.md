# 🎓 Scholarship Eligibility Evaluator (AI-Assisted Prototype)

> A **conversion-focused EdTech prototype** built to standardize and automate scholarship distribution using profile-based eligibility logic instead of random or manual discounts.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Most EdTech platforms distribute scholarships:

* Randomly or manually
* Without transparency or reasoning
* Equally to low-intent and high-intent users

This results in:

* Revenue leakage
* Low perceived scholarship value
* Delayed enrollment decisions

---

## 💡 Solution

The **Scholarship Eligibility Evaluator** introduces a structured, automated approach where scholarships are **earned**, not randomly assigned.

The system:

1. Collects learner profile data (job role, experience, CTC, intent)
2. Applies rule-based eligibility logic
3. Displays a personalized eligibility result with clear reasoning
4. Creates instant feedback → urgency → FOMO

---

## 🧠 AI Framing (Honest & Industry-Correct)

This prototype uses **AI-assisted decision logic**, not black-box machine learning.

* Rule-based, explainable eligibility engine
* Designed to evolve into ML-based scoring models
* Mirrors real-world production systems (logic → data → learning)

---

## 🖥️ Application Flow

1. Landing page to communicate scholarship value
2. Eligibility form to capture structured inputs
3. Evaluation layer to process rules
4. Results page to show outcome & benefits

## 🧩 Eligibility Parameters

The evaluator currently considers:

* Current company
* Job role
* Years of experience
* Current CTC (LPA)
* Program interest
* User intent (qualitative input)

These inputs map to predefined scholarship tiers.

---

## 🎯 Business Impact

* Eliminates random scholarship allocation
* Rewards serious, high-intent learners
* Reduces manual counselor dependency
* Encourages faster enrollment decisions

Acts as a **pre-sales qualification layer**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Frontend: React / HTML / CSS
* Logic Layer: Rule-based evaluation engine
* Focus: Conversion-optimized UX
* Config: Environment-based setup

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* No ML training yet (rule-based only)
* Static eligibility thresholds
* No real user analytics integrated

These are intentional for a prototype stage.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* ML-based eligibility scoring
* A/B testing for conversion optimization
* Counselor & admin dashboard
* CRM and payment gateway integration

---

## 🚀 Local Setup

```bash
cd scholarship-evaluator
npm install
npm start
```

Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` before running the project.
